                            At Fresh Foods, we believe in getting grocery shopping done right. 
                            The problem with existing grocery shopping websites is that they are 
                            not interactive enough and can be buggy while being hard to navigate. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p%>
                            Our mission is to recreate the smooth and easy in-person shopping experience 
                            that can be reachable and done by anyone, at the comfort of your own home! 
                            We put the work into making this website so you don't have to.
                        </p>

                        <p%>
                            Using our website, you'll find just how easy it is to shop for what you need 
                            from across many different stores, all in one place. It is often overlooked 
                            how many shoppers struggle to accomplish this. We are 
                            here to relieve you of that burden, using what we know about being user friendly. 
                        </p>

                        <p%>
                            The way to an easier process starts with you, the shopper, in mind. 
                            This means thoughtfully designing the look and feel of each part of what you see and interact with. 
                            Here at Fresh Foods we aim to meet your needs and preferences on how YOU would like to shop.

                        <p%>Ever since I was a child, I have always been fascinated with being healthy. I thought it would be a 
                            perfect way to spread my love for healthy food by creating a website with my friends! I also enjoy 
                            running and weightlifting in my spare time. I want to make the globe as healthy as possible!</p>

                        <p%>Growing up, I always wished that things would be made easier for people use. Making resources and 
                            other things accessible to others was also important to me. This is why myself and my team decided 
                            to make a place that anyone can go to shop online and not stress about how hard it used to be to 
                            just order what you need. Aside from this, I enjoy spending time outside with friends and playing sports.

                        <p%>Food! I developed a passion for food ever since I was young and it's something that connects many 
                            different cultures together. However one thing that I always found difficult was finding one place 
                            to find everything I need. So it became my misson to try and create a place where food can be accessible 
                            to all people conveniently all in one place. Luckily enough, I was able to find people who had similar
                            goals to me and we were able to come up with Fresh Foods. Besides my passion for food, I love to spend
                            my time traveling to many different places as well and also playing basketball.
